# Thanks for dialing in

I'm glad you're here to see my progressively worsening relationship with computers!

## >lslogins -u saren

I'm a huge nerd (peer-reviewed claim) who's been messing around with all manner of digital stuff since 2009, going from courses to projects to a destiny yet unknown. I like poking around things until they break and then using the not-so-broken parts to build something useful.

When I'm not in an IDE or TTY emulator, I'm editing videos, learning about computing past, photographing the spaces we inhabit, or just vibing to music (sometimes live on air)

With my interests spanning network applications, media preservation, and hardware+OS exploration there's a bit of stuff to see on my [GitHub](https://github.com/SarenDev). I usually write things in Python, but some of my more popular work is written in C# and Java.

Well, I think you're ready to see the rest of the stuff I got! The links at the top of the page will bring you to my [GitHub](https://github.com/SarenDev) and [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/sarendev) profiles, but, in case they don't work, the ones in this post are also clickable. Also, by the time you connect in the *not so distant future*, this page might have new posts!

Thanks for taking the time to read this and **see you on the net**!
